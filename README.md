# GifTastic

This project demonstrated the use of Jquery, CSS, and HTML, AJAX, and also an API. Using these aspects, I was able to build a giphy generator that pulled data from the Giphy API and incorporated it onto my program. 

Getting Started: Access the giphy generator here at https://samuelpai.github.io/GifTastic/. Once directed to the URL, click on one of the buttons to display various gifs in the div section below. There should be 10 of them. In order to make the gifs animated, simply click on the image to start, and click again to make it still. You can also type in any additional desserts of your choice in the search bar and click submit. This will add a new button for you to click and to generate 10 new gifs of that new dessert.

Prerequisites None

Built With CSS HTML Javascript Jquery AJAX Giphy API
